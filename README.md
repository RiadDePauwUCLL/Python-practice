# Python-practice
Within this repository lies multiple python exercises I have done as meant for practice &amp; understanding the programming language better as a whole.

Within the solution file, you will find most answers I have gotten from practicing & learning. It might not always be formal, just a caution as I tend to have fun coding! :)

If you want to test your results, don't forget to get the test framework from Codewars as most of these exercises will come from there.
Source: https://github.com/codewars/python-test-framework

Later on, I will add on this README how to use the framework. For the moment, proceed with using & reading the documentation below if want to be able to check ur code outside of using it on codewars:
https://docs.codewars.com/languages/python/codewars-test/


If you don't want to use the framework, I'd recommend to try all the exercises below by doing them within the collections. I'll show an example of how they work with a video added. 
All solutions for the 50 exercises and counting are within the solutions.py file.
