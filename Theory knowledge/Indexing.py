# Ahh, I love this part. Mostly because it confuses me sometimes, haha women fk you
# Ok, imagine this: you want to have the specific index position of a word. How u do dis?

word = "monke"
print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[2])
print(word[3])
print(word[4])
# Keep in mind here, we start from 0. 0 As being the letter "m" here.

# What if the word is too long, how do I get the last index then?
# Simple my brotha.
print(f'\nHow 2 us keybord: ' + word[-1])

# What about going backwards, is that possible too? Yes my friend, programming is magic.
print(f'\nHow 2 us keybord but revers: ' + word[-2])
