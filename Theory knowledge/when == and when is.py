# Terminology

# In order to be able to express ourselves unambiguously, we introduce the following terminology:
#   Two objects x and y are equal if x == y is True (same content).
#   Two objects x and y are the same if x is y is True (same content & same memory address).

# Two same objects are always equal, but not all equal objects are the same.
