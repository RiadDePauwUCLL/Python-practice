#                               Inputs

# How does inputs work? For example, what if I want to type in my name, 
# and keep it within a variable? 
# Here's how you can do it.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)
# It's going to proceed with printing out your name!
# But, what about integers then?
integer = input("gimme yo numba hoe: ")
print(integer)
# It's always going to turn the input into a string, no matter what. But it's possible to do it otherwise.
