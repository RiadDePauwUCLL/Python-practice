# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
# And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
# Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! 
# You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; 
# in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

# Examples
# -1  =>  false
#  0  =>  true
#  3  =>  false
#  4  =>  true
# 25  =>  true
# 26  =>  false
# Write ur code here:

# The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. 
# They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

# To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. 
# In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

# Input
# Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. 
# Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

# Output
# Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) 
# stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

# Example
# input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]

# In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. 
# For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

# The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. 
# For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, 
# four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

# Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction 
# and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

# You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer 
# as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. 
# Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

# The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

# Examples:
# s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
# printer_error(s) => "0/14"

# s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
# printer_error(s) => "8/22"

# Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

# Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

# The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

# Examples: (Input --> Output)

# [] --> []
# ["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
# Write ur code here:

def number(lines):
    return [f"{counter}: {line}" for counter, line in enumerate(lines, start=1)]

# enumerate is a built-in function of Python. It returns an enumerate object.
# It allows us to loop over something with an implemented counter & 
# generates an index for each item in the loop.
# counter basically loops itself over the lines, starting from 1.







# Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. 
# Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

# Examples:
# a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
# b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
# longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

# a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write ur code here:

def longest(a1,a2):
    combined_set = set(a1 + a2)
    sorted_result = ''.join(sorted(combined_set))

    return sorted_result

#Just found it there's a better way of doing it:
def longest(a1,a2):
    return ''.join(sorted(set(a1 + a2)))

# here, we are using set() to store the unique values from a1 and a2.
# then, we are using sorted() to sort the values from combined_set.
# then, we are using ''.join() to join the sorted values from combined_set.

# set() is an unordered collection of unique items.
# set() is used to store unique values from a string.
# set() is used to remove duplicates from a list.
# set() is mutable, i.e., we can change its elements once it is created.
# set() is unordered, i.e., it doesn't remember the order of insertion.







# Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

# count_by(1,10) should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# count_by(2,5) should return [2,4,6,8,10]
# Write ur code here:

# Remove every other within a list! AKA slicing.
# Take an array and remove every second element from the array. 
# Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

# Example:
# ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

# None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
# Write ur code here:

def remove_every_other(my_list):

# If you want a more pythonic way of doing it, you can use list slicing:
def remove_every_other(my_list):

# list slicing is a way to extract a portion of a list.
# list slicing is done by defining the start, stop, and step values.
# list slicing is done by using the colon operator.







# How 2 filter a list!
# In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers

# filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
# filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]
# Write ur code here:

def filter_list(l):
    filter = []
    for num in l:

# Square Digits
# Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

# For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

# Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

# Happy Coding!
# Write ur code here:

def square_digits(num):
    str_num = str(num)
    squared_digits = [str(int(digits) ** 2) for digits in str_num]
    result = ''.join(squared_digits)

# You got two ways of doing it. The first one is the one I did, which is the most clever one. The other one is more simple:

def square_digits(num):

    for x in str(num):
        ret += str(int(x)**2)
    return int(ret)





# Prime numbers
# In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

# Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

# The function needs to return either a true or false.

# Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

# Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.
# Write ur code here:

def is_even(n): 
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
# this makes it clearer on how it works. But you can also do it like this, just less readable:

# Move the zeros!
# Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end,

        elif lst[i] < 1:
            zero.append(lst[i])
    new_lst.extend(zero)

# Ingredients & Cakes
# Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. 
# Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

# Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) 
# and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). 

# For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). 
# Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

# Examples:

#  must return 2
# cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200})
#  must return 0
# cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000})

# Write ur code here:

def cakes(recipe, available):
    try:
        return min([available[a] // recipe[a] for a in recipe])
    except:
        return 0
    
# Or, you could also work with lists:
    
def cakes(recipe, available):
    list = []
    for ingredient in recipe:
        if ingredient in available:
            list.append(available[ingredient] // recipe[ingredient])
        else:
            return 0
    return min(list)
    
# here, we are using try and except.
# try and except are used to prevent the code from crashing.
# return min() returns the smallest number from the list.
# available[a] / recipe[a] returns the number of servings for each ingredient.
# recipe[a] returns the amount of each ingredient needed.
# available[a] returns the amount of each ingredient available.
# it returns 0 if there is not enough ingredients to make the cake.

# There is also a different way of doing it, but it's a bit more complex:

def cakes(recipe, available):
    max_servings = float('inf')
    for ingredient, amount in recipe.items():
        if ingredient in available:
            servings = available[ingredient] // amount
            max_servings = min(max_servings, servings)
        else:
            return 0
    return max_servings

# In Python, float('inf') represents positive infinity, which is a mathematical concept indicating an unbounded positive value. 
# It is a special floating-point representation that is greater than any finite floating-point number.

# Here's a breakdown of the expression float('inf'):

# float: This is a built-in function in Python that converts a number or a string to a floating-point number. 
# In this case, it's used to explicitly convert the string 'inf' to a floating-point representation.

# 'inf': This is a string representing infinity. The use of 'inf' is a convention in Python to denote positive infinity.

# So, float('inf') creates a floating-point representation of positive infinity. 
# This is commonly used in situations where you want to initialize a variable to a value that is guaranteed to be greater than any finite number. 
# In the context of the previous code snippets, max_servings is initialized to positive infinity so that, during the iteration over ingredients, 
# it can be updated with the minimum of the current value and the calculated servings, ensuring it eventually holds the smallest possible number of servings.








# Count all characters within string
# The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. 
# If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

# What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.
# Write ur code here:

def count(s):
    return {x : s.count(x) for x in set(s)}

# here, we are using set(s) to store the unique values from s.
# then, we are using count(x) to count the number of times each character appears in s thanks to the for loop.








# IPs between eachother
# Implement a function that receives two IPv4 addresses, and returns the number of addresses between them (including the first one, excluding the last one).

# All inputs will be valid IPv4 addresses in the form of strings. The last address will always be greater than the first one.

# Examples
# * With input "10.0.0.0", "10.0.0.50"  => return   50 
# * With input "10.0.0.0", "10.0.1.0"   => return  256 
# * With input "20.0.0.10", "20.0.1.0"  => return  246
# Write ur code here:

def ips_between(start, end):
    def ip_to_int(ip):
        return sum(int(part) * 256 ** i for i, part in enumerate(reversed(ip.split('.'))))
    
    return ip_to_int(end) - ip_to_int(start)

# alternative & faster method:

from ipaddress import ip_address

def ips_between(start, end):
    return int(ip_address(end)) - int(ip_address(start))








# Find odd number
# Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

# There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

# Examples
# [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
# [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
# Write ur code here:

def find_it(seq):

# Disemvowel Trolls

# Remove the minimum
# The museum of incredible dull things
# The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. 
# Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring 
# exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

# However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, 
# so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings 
# of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

# Task
# Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. 
# If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. 
# If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

# Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

# Examples:
# * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
# * Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
# * Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
# Write ur code here:

# Counting Duplicates
# Count the number of Duplicates
# Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters 
# and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. 
# The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets 
# (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

# Example:

# "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
# "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
# "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
# "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
# "aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
# "ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice
# Write ur code here:

def duplicate_count(text):
    text = text.lower()
    dupes = 0
    for char in set(text):
        if text.count(char) > 1:

# Simplistic code, you don't have to make it more complex than that.








# Remove first & last character
# It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function 
# that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
# You're given one parameter, the original string.

# Convert a string to an array

# Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.

# Unique In Order

# Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items 
# without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

# For example:

# unique_in_order('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
# unique_in_order('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
# unique_in_order([1, 2, 2, 3, 3])   == [1, 2, 3]
# unique_in_order((1, 2, 2, 3, 3))   == [1, 2, 3]

# Write ur code here:

    result = []
    for i in sequence:
        if not result or i != result[-1]:
            result.append(i)

# find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
# find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
# Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

# The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

# Write ur code here:

# Your order, please

# Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. 
# This number is the position the word should have in the result.

# Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

# If the input string is empty, return an empty string. 
# The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

# Examples
# "is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
# "4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"

# Sum of numbers

# Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. 
# If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

# Note: a and b are not ordered!

# Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
# (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
# (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
# (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
# (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
# (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
# (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
# Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.

# Write ur code here:

def get_sum(a, b):

# Regex validate PIN code

# ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

# "12345"  -->  false
# "a234"   -->  false

# Write ur code here:

def validate_pin(pin):

# Fake Binary

# Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with '0' and any digit 5 and above with '1'.

# Delete occurences of an element if it occurs more than n times

# Enough is enough!

# Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. 
# However, Charlie doesn't like these sessions, since the motif usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times.
# He tells them that he will only sit for the session if they show the same motif at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motif as a number. 
# Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order?

# Task

# Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.
# For example if the input number is 2, and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], 
# drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
# With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, the result would be [20,37,21].

# Write ur code here:

def delete_nth(order, max_e):
    enough = order[::-1]

    for i in order:
        if enough.count(i) > max_e:
            enough.remove(i)

# this is basically reversing the list, deleting the "last" occuring digit and then reversing it again to it's original order.
#  :)






# Sum of positive

# You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

# Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

# Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

# Write ur code here:

def positive_sum(arr):
    sum = 0
    for i in arr:
        if i > 0:
            sum += i
    return sum







# Count of positives / sum of negatives

# Given an array of integers.

# Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers 
# and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 
# 0 is neither positive nor negative.

# If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.

# Example
# For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], 
# you should return [10, -65].
