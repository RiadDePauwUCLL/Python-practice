# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
# And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
# Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! 
# You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; 
# in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

# Examples
# -1  =>  false
#  0  =>  true
#  3  =>  false
#  4  =>  true
# 25  =>  true
# 26  =>  false
# Write ur code here:

# The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. 
# They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

# To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. 
# In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

# Input
# Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. 
# Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

# Output
# Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) 
# stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

# Example
# input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]

# In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. 
# For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

# The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. 
# For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, 
# four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

# Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction 
# and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

# You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer 
# as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. 
# Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

# The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

# Examples:
# s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
# printer_error(s) => "0/14"

# s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
# printer_error(s) => "8/22"
# Write ur code here:

# Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

# Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

# The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

# Examples: (Input --> Output)

# [] --> []
# ["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
# Write ur code here:

def number(lines):
    return [f"{counter}: {line}" for counter, line in enumerate(lines, start=1)]

# enumerate is a built-in function of Python. It returns an enumerate object.
# It allows us to loop over something with an implemented counter & 
# generates an index for each item in the loop.
# counter basically loops itself over the lines, starting from 1.







# Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. 
# Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

# Examples:
# a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
# b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
# longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

# a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write ur code here:

def longest(a1,a2):
    combined_set = set(a1 + a2)
    sorted_result = ''.join(sorted(combined_set))

    return sorted_result

#Just found it there's a better way of doing it:
def longest(a1,a2):
    return ''.join(sorted(set(a1 + a2)))

# here, we are using set() to store the unique values from a1 and a2.
# then, we are using sorted() to sort the values from combined_set.
# then, we are using ''.join() to join the sorted values from combined_set.

# set() is an unordered collection of unique items.
# set() is used to store unique values from a string.
# set() is used to remove duplicates from a list.
# set() is mutable, i.e., we can change its elements once it is created.
# set() is unordered, i.e., it doesn't remember the order of insertion.







# Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

# Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

# count_by(1,10) should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# count_by(2,5) should return [2,4,6,8,10]
# Write ur code here:

# Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. 
# Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

# Take an array and remove every second element from the array. 
# Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

# Example:
# ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

# None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

# If you want a more pythonic way of doing it, you can use list slicing:
def remove_every_other(my_list):

# list slicing is a way to extract a portion of a list.
# list slicing is done by defining the start, stop, and step values.
# list slicing is done by using the colon operator.

# Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

# Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. 
# Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

# Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) 
# and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). 

# For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). 
# Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

# Examples:

#  must return 2
# cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200})
#  must return 0
# cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000})

# Write ur code here:

def cakes(recipe, available):
    try:
        return min([available[a]/recipe[a] for a in recipe])
    except:
        return 0

# There is also a different way of doing it, but it's a bit more complex:

def cakes(recipe, available):
    max_servings = float('inf')
    for ingredient, amount in recipe.items():
        if ingredient in available:
            servings = available[ingredient] // amount
            max_servings = min(max_servings, servings)
        else:
            return 0
    return max_servings

# In Python, float('inf') represents positive infinity, which is a mathematical concept indicating an unbounded positive value. 
# It is a special floating-point representation that is greater than any finite floating-point number.

# Here's a breakdown of the expression float('inf'):

# float: This is a built-in function in Python that converts a number or a string to a floating-point number. 
# In this case, it's used to explicitly convert the string 'inf' to a floating-point representation.

# 'inf': This is a string representing infinity. The use of 'inf' is a convention in Python to denote positive infinity.

# So, float('inf') creates a floating-point representation of positive infinity. 
# This is commonly used in situations where you want to initialize a variable to a value that is guaranteed to be greater than any finite number. 
# In the context of the previous code snippets, max_servings is initialized to positive infinity so that, during the iteration over ingredients, 
# it can be updated with the minimum of the current value and the calculated servings, ensuring it eventually holds the smallest possible number of servings.
