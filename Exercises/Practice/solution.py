#        Count sheep
#        If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!
#
#        Task:
#        Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.
#Write ur code here:

def count_sheep(n):
    return ''.join(f'{n} sheep...' for n in range(1, n + 1))










#        Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.
#        
#        Reverse words
#        Examples
#        "This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
#        "double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"
#Write ur code here:

def reverse_words(text):
    words = text.split(' ')
    word = [words[::-1] for word in words]
    reversed_text = ' '.join(word)
    return reversed_text









#           In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
#           Make number negative
#
#           Examples
#           make_negative(1);  # return -1
#           make_negative(-5); # return -5
#           make_negative(0);  # return 0
#           Notes
#           The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
#           Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
# Write ur code here:           XD

def make_negative(number):
    if number > 0:
        return -number
    else:
        return number

# You're a square!

# Output
# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

# Examples
# -1  =>  false
#  0  =>  true
#  3  =>  false
#  4  =>  true
# 25  =>  true
# 26  =>  false
# Write ur code here:

def is_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    square_root = int(math.sqrt(n))
    square_number = square_root * square_root
    if square_number == n:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    














# The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

# To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

# Input
# Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

# Output
# Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

# Example
# input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
# output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]
# Write ur code here:

def open_or_senior(data):
    result = []
    
    for member in data:
        age, handicap = member
        
        if age >= 55 and handicap > 7:
            result.append("Senior")
        else:
            result.append("Open")

# Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

# For example:

# Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
# Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
# You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
# Write ur code here:

def find_smallest_int(arr):
    return min(arr)









# In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

# The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

# Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

# You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

# The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

# Examples:
# s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
# printer_error(s) => "0/14"

# s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
# printer_error(s) => "8/22"
# Write ur code here:

def printer_error(s):
    printer_error = 0
    
    for i in s:
        if ord(i) > ord('m'):
            printer_error += 1
    return f'{printer_error}/{len(s)}'




# Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

# We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

# The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
# Write ur code here:

def get_count(sentence):
    vowels = 0
    given_vowels = "aeiou"
    for char in sentence:
        if char.lower() in given_vowels:
            vowels += 1
    return vowels





# In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

# Examples
# high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
# high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
# high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"
# Notes
# All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
# There will always be at least one number in the input string.
# Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.
# Write ur code here:

def high_and_low(numbers):
    numbers = [int(n) for n in numbers.split()]
    max_num = max(numbers)
    min_num = min(numbers)
    return f'{max_num} {min_num}'








# Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

# Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

# Example:

# Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
# Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
# Write ur code here:

def to_jaden_case(string):
    return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in string.split())









# Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

# For example,

# [True,  True,  True,  False,
#   True,  True,  True,  True ,
#   True,  False, True,  False,
#   True,  False, False, True ,
#   True,  True,  True,  True ,
#   False, False, True,  True]
# The correct answer would be 17.

# Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined
# Write ur code here:

def count_sheeps(sheep):
    count = 0
    for i in sheep:
        if i:
            count += 1
    return count
